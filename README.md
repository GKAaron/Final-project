# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
Using Monte Carlo Simulation simulates the number of customers for each day in Bank of China in my hometown and the amount of time for each individual affair. Those two simulations will help me to approximately evaluate the average waiting time for customers given a specific amount of counters. Finally, I will try to find out the best amount of counters with respect to both bank and customers 
### Hypothesis before running the simulation:
My simulation is trying to figure out an answer to the above question. Thus I don't do any hypothesis.
### Simulation's variables of uncertainty
Two main variables. The number of cutomers visiting the bank each day and the amount of time for each individual affair.

## Instructions on how to use the program:
Using queue to simulate the waiting line.
